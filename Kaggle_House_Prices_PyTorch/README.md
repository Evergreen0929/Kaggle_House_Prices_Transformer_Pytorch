## Project Objective <a name="p objective"></a>
This is my first project in PyTorch. The aim of the project is to perform a simple multivariate regression using Transformer model. 

## Python Packages
1. PyTorch=1.8.0
2. numpy=1.19.2
3. matplotlib=3.3.4
4. pandas=1.1.5
Get packages by using conda or pip.

## Kaggle
Once finished, you can upload your prediction.csv to the kaggle website where you can compare your score with other users.

## Acknowledgement
You need to have more than 4GB GPU memory to train the model with default settings, or you need to change batchsize or the network sturctures.
